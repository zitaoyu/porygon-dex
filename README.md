# Secret Base

Secret Base serves as a wiki site for the Pokémon main series games, dedicated to the Pokémon community. Since most other wiki sites are primarily designed for desktop clients, navigating them on a mobile device can be challenging. The goal of this project is to ensure smooth site navigation for both mobile and desktop browsers.
